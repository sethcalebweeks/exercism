## Running the tests

You can run the test suite for the exercise by executing the appropriate command:

If the `rakutest` file is contained in the `t/` directory:
`prove6 --lib`

If the `rakutest` file is in the top-level directory:
`prove6 {exercise-name}.rakutest`

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit Accumulate.rakumod` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
